Gradle

1. Build tools overview:

	1.1 Ant
	1.2 Maven
		1.2.1 Convention over configuration
		1.2.2 Declarative Vs. Imperative	
	
2. Why do we need another build tool? (Taken from Gentle introduction to Gradle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFUEb7pLLXw):

	2.1 Both Maven and Ant presented key inovation when they where introduced, however today there are more requirements from a build tool.
	    In addition, not all entrprise projects are alike which require different build process.

	2.2 Projects today contain a lot of modules and code.

	2.3 Tommorrow build will also need custom automated deployment tommorrow.

	Answer: It is needed to be able to give developers the ability to build a custom build tool that will fit their needs without needing to "invent" the wheel ourself.


3. Gradle overview
	short description 
	Gradle likes you to be as much as declerative as possible, but not the inforce opinions on the build
	Gradle want the build to be adaptable. It provides basic conventions, however you can add your own conventions in a flexible way
	Where does Gradle fit between Ant and Maven
	who uses it (is it really needed?)
	hello world example (take a look on Gradleware webinars)	
	Discuss the fact that Plugins are a way for Gradle to be declerative and not imperative
	Pros/Cons
	
3. Gradle in a nutshell

4. Main differences between Gradle and Maven

5. Demo
 	show the javadoc as a reference to the things I presented in the hello world example
	Present task input functionality
	Show project dependencies (changing a project also compiles his deoendant project)

6. summary + comparison between the build tools

Some points:
============

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1163173/why-use-gradle-instead-of-ant-or-maven:
This may be a bit controversial, but Gradle doesn't hide the fact that it's a fully-fledged programming language.
Ant + ant-contrib is essentially a turing complete programming language that no one really wants to program in.
Maven tries to take the opposite approach of trying to be completely declarative and forcing you to write and compile a plugin if you need logic. It also imposes a project model that is completely inflexible. Gradle combines the best of all these tools:
It follows convention-over-configuration (ala Maven) but only to the extent you want itIt lets you write flexible custom tasks like in AntIt provides multi-module project support that is superior to both Ant and MavenIt has a DSL that makes the 80% things easy and the 20% things possible (unlike other build tools that make the 80% easy, 10% possible and 10% effectively impossible).
Not sure how to quantify this, but it is really just so refreshing to think "how am I going to solve this?" as opposed to "what are the viable options my build tool is going to leave me to achieve this?"
